# Project ssDNA Results:  
1. This repository contains the codes to make graphs or analysis in the ssDNA project.  
2. In the EBYTYPE.PLOT directory I calculated the average energy for protein DNA interactions both for stacking and electrostatics.  
3. In the COMPARE.DIFF.LEN directory I compared the diffusion coefficients and intersegmental transfers between the different lengths of DNA.  
4.
