# Project ssDNA Results:  
1. This repository contains the codes to make graphs or analysis in the ssDNA project.  
2. In the EBYTYPE.PLOT directory I calculated the average energy for protein DNA interactions both for stacking and electrostatics.  
3. In the COMPARE.DIFF.LEN directory I compared the diffusion coefficients and intersegmental transfers between the different lengths of DNA.  
4. In the DIFF.DIS.DIFF.SALT directory I compared the diffusion coefficients for diffrent end-to-end distances of the DNA having length 235 nt.  
   Also compared the effect of salt for this same length and same distances changing the dihedral potential.  
5. The INT.TRANSFERS directroy contains the graph plotting and everything I have done using the number of intersegmental transfers during the simulation.  
   (Here to calculate the diffusion coefficient or to calculate intersegmental transfers I used codes which I kept in the CODES repository.)
